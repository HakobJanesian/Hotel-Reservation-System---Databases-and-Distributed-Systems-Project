# Hotel Reservation System Database Project

## Overview
This project entails the development of a database for a hotel reservation system. It is designed to cater to three key stakeholders: potential customers, hotel accountants, and hotel managers. The database is structured to facilitate room bookings, financial analysis, trend identification, and customer feedback analysis.

## Project Phases
1. **Initial Planning**: Identifying entities, attributes, and constraints relevant to real-world hotel reservation systems.
2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Creation**: Designing the ERD to understand relationships and participations (total, partial).
3. **Database Implementation**: Converting the ERD into actual database tables, defining primary keys, and setting appropriate references.
4. **Data Population**: Filling the database with data, a combination of manually created entries and Python-generated records.
5. **Query Development**: Writing SQL queries to analyze data and extract information to meet stakeholder needs.

## Stakeholders
- **Customers**: For booking hotel rooms.
- **Accountants**: To perform financial analysis.
- **Managers**: To identify trends and analyze customer feedback.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **ERD Conversion**: Addressed complexities in converting the ERD to a functional database schema.
- **Data Population**: Overcame logical complications in data generation by combining manual and automated methods.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: PostgreSQL
- **Programming Languages**: SQL for queries, Python for data generation.

## Usage
- **Database Setup**: Follow the instructions to set up the database schema and populate the initial data.
- **Running Queries**: Execute the provided SQL queries to extract specific data and insights as per stakeholder requirements.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to designing and implementing a database for a hotel reservation system, addressing the needs of various stakeholders through careful planning, ERD design, and strategic query development.

## Future Work
- Expansion of the database to include more complex functionalities.
- Automation of data population for more dynamic data generation.
- Enhancement of the query set to provide deeper insights for stakeholders.
